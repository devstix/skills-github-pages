It came to him, 
in his hour of need.
Protect and defend,
from his tower of grief.

Let it be known,
Far and wide.
Let it be known,
Our dragon flies.

He chose his fate,
To rid of hate.
Rider of Hope,
Never too late.

Those promised lands,
Of forgotten times.
He sought the truth ,
To see the good.

This timeless war,
It goes on and on.
What we believe ,
He will conceive 

Let it be known
The dragon rides
With cosmic winds
To end the fight.  

Let it be known,
Our dragon flies
To turn the tide ,
Of this endless war.

Oh let it be known,
That the dragon flies â€¦
