It came to him, in his hour of need.  
Protect and defend,from his tower of grief.  

Let it be known, far and wide.  
Let it be known, our dragon flies.  

He chose his fate, to rid of hate.  
Rider of Hope, never too late.  

Those promised lands, of forgotten times.  
He sought the truth , to see the good.  

This timeless war, it goes on and on.  
What we believe, he will conceive.  

Let it be known, the dragon rides.  
With cosmic winds, to end the fight. 

Let it be known, our dragon flies.  
To turn the tide, of this endless war 

Oh let it be known, that the dragon flies...
